# Neel Desai — Dual-Mode Portfolio

> A portfolio website that speaks two languages: one for recruiters and one for developers.

🔗 **Live Site**: [https://portfolio-neel-desai.vercel.app/](https://portfolio-neel-desai.vercel.app/)

## What Is This?

This is a **personal portfolio website** with a twist — it has **two completely different interfaces** built into one application:

### 🎨 HR Mode (Visual)

The default experience. Opens with a polished **landing page** showcasing my profile, skills highlights, and action buttons. Scroll down to discover an **interactive graph** where my projects, skills, summary, experience, initiatives, and academics are represented as clickable, draggable nodes — like a mind map you can explore.

### 💻 Dev Mode (Terminal)

A fully functional **command-line terminal** where technically-minded visitors can type commands like `projects`, `skills`, or `open portfolio-system` to navigate the same content through a CLI experience. Complete with autocomplete (press Tab!), command history (Arrow keys), and familiar terminal aesthetics.

**Both modes show the exact same content** — just presented differently depending on who's viewing it.

## How to Update Content

**No coding required.** All content is stored in simple JSON files inside `src/data/`. Open any file, change the text, and the site updates automatically.

### Quick Reference

| What to Change          | Which File to Edit          |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Name, bio, contact info | `src/data/profile.json`     |
| Projects                | `src/data/projects.json`    |
| Skills (categorized)    | `src/data/skills.json`      |
| Career summary          | `src/data/summary.json`     |
| Experience              | `src/data/experience.json`  |
| Initiatives             | `src/data/initiatives.json` |
| Academics               | `src/data/academics.json`   |
| Graph colors            | `src/data/graphConfig.json` |
| Terminal commands       | `src/data/commands.json`    |
| UI labels & text        | `src/data/uiStrings.json`   |

### Example: Adding a New Project

Open `src/data/projects.json` and add an entry:

```json
{
    "id": "my-new-project",
    "title": "My New Project",
    "shortDescription": "A brief one-liner.",
    "detailedDescription": "A full paragraph about what this project does...",
    "stack": ["React", "TypeScript", "Node.js"],
    "githubLink": "https://github.com/...",
    "liveLink": "https://...",
    "featured": true
}
```

It will automatically appear in the graph, the terminal's `projects` command, and be accessible via `open my-new-project`.

| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **React 19**       | UI framework — components, hooks, lazy loading, Suspense                        |
| **TypeScript**     | Type safety across all components, data, and state                              |
| **Vite 7**         | Lightning-fast build tool with hot module replacement                           |
| **Zustand**        | Lightweight global state (mode, theme, UI flags) with localStorage persistence  |
| **Tailwind CSS 4** | Utility-first styling with a full HSL design token system for light/dark themes |
| **shadcn/ui**      | 50+ accessible UI primitives (dialog, avatar, toast, input, etc.)               |
| **Lucide React**   | Clean, consistent icon set                                                      |
| **React Router**   | Client-side routing with URL param support (`?mode=dev`)                        |

### Architecture Highlights

- **Mode transition system**: Every mode switch triggers a full-screen cinematic animation (network-forming for HR, boot sequence for Dev) managed by a Zustand `modeTransition` flag.
- **Pointer-based drag & drop**: The graph canvas uses the Pointer Events API with `setPointerCapture` for reliable cross-device node dragging (mouse + touch).
- **Omnidirectional scrolling**: The canvas dynamically computes bounding boxes and adjusts scroll position when nodes are dragged or expanded, supporting scroll in all four directions.
- **Lazy-loaded graph**: The graph component loads only when scrolled into view via `IntersectionObserver` + `React.lazy()`.
- **Zero hardcoded strings**: Every label, message, and content block comes from JSON — the UI components contain only structure and logic.
- **Semantic CSS tokens**: 30+ HSL CSS custom properties define the design system, with separate token sets for the standard UI and terminal UI, each with light and dark variants.
- **System theme detection**: Reads `prefers-color-scheme` on load and listens for real-time OS theme changes.
